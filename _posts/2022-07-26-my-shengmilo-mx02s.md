# My Sheng Milo MX02S Infos

Here's some notes about my Sheng Milo MX02S.

# Brake lever adjustment. (~2400km/2022-06-28)
The right brake lever was no longer depressing the brake cutoff switch, requiring constant outward pressure during cycling.
Solved by rotating the middle adjustment screw of the right brake lever counterclockwise.

# Brake Pads replacement. (~1950km)
I needed to replace my Sheng Milo MX02S Brake Pads at ~1950km

Brakes: XOD XD-H500. Seems to be a clone of the Tektro HD-E500.  
Replacement Pads: [BBS-52](https://bbbcycling.com/nl_nl/bbs-52-discstop-hp). Pads compatible with HD-E500 should be fine.

# Pedal replacement (1800km)
One of the pedals started havint trouble rotating around 1800km, so I replaced them.
Seems like pedal mounting is very standard.

# Bike Stem Riser replacement.
As the standard steering was a bit low for me, I replaced it with an adjustable bike stem riser.
I got an Hiland Universal Bike Stem Riser. 90mm/31.8mm.
