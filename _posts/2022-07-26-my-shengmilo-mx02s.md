# My Sheng Milo MX02S maintenance log

Here's some notes about my Sheng Milo MX02S.

# Replaced PAS Sensor (2023-04)
PAS sensor was randomly cutting out and worse, randomly activating when stopped, due to it working loose from the frame and dirt coming inside.
Replaced it with https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005170320594.html

# Motor is noisy at >20km/h (2023-07)
At higher speeds, hear sound. Disassembled motor. Showed some gears missing pieces.

# Battery cradle got loose (2023)
The shape of the frame allows side to side motion of the battery cradle, creating more and more play over time.  
I filled the space between the frame and the cradle with copious amounts of hot glue, eliminating side to side motion.

# Speedometer died (~3900km/2023-01)
Speedometer no longer shows >0km. Odometer no longer increases.

# Tighten rear wheel spokes (~2900km/2022-09-10)
Noticed many (>10) rear spokes were loose. Tightened them with the supplied tool.

# Brake lever locktite (~2650km/2022-08-09)
The adjustment screw kept rattling loose. Used a loctite-like product to keep it in place.

# Brake lever adjustment. (~2400km/2022-06-28)
The right brake lever was no longer depressing the brake cutoff switch, requiring constant outward pressure during cycling.
Solved by rotating the middle adjustment screw of the right brake lever counterclockwise.

# Brake Pads replacement. (~1950km)
I needed to replace my Sheng Milo MX02S Brake Pads at ~1950km

Brakes: XOD XD-H500. Seems to be a clone of the Tektro HD-E500.  
Replacement Pads: [BBS-52](https://bbbcycling.com/nl_nl/bbs-52-discstop-hp). Pads compatible with HD-E500 should be fine.

# Pedal replacement (1800km)
One of the pedals started havint trouble rotating around 1800km, so I replaced them.
Seems like pedal mounting is very standard.

# Bike Stem Riser replacement.
As the standard steering was a bit low for me, I replaced it with an adjustable bike stem riser.
I got an Hiland Universal Bike Stem Riser. 90mm/31.8mm.

# Dates
Delivery: February 2021.
