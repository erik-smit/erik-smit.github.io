To be able to switch my peripherals between the desktop PC and the devices connected via USB-C to my LG 40WP95C I use an (HDMI/)USB-switch, SKU: DZWP2019. The USB switch uses USB-A ports for both upstream and downstream. Connection to the desktop is USB-A - USB-A. Connection to the LG is USB-C to USB-A.

Problem: When the desktop is not on, the USB Switch is not working. Because the USB-C upstream port on the 40WP95C doesn't provide 5Vusb.

Solution: Use USB-C/USB-A adapters on the connection to the LG which tell the USB-C side to provide power.
