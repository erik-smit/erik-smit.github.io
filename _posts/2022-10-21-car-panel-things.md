For my USB-powerbank-powered-by-ebike-battery-project I was looking at AliExpress car panel items.  
There seems to be a semi-standard for 3cm car panel items.  

A common manufacturer seems [You Liang](https://www.aliexpress.com/store/5254006).

Here's an overview I made for myself.

| Brand | Type | Input | Output |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| YOULIANG | DKTU | 36v-108v | 2x5v2.1a |
| YOULIANG | YPUq | 12v-24v | USB-A (18w) + USB-C (18w) |
| YOULIANG | ATU(QJ) | 12-24v | USB-A (22.5w) + USB-C (18w) |
| YOULIANG | YW | 12-24v | Voltage Meter |
