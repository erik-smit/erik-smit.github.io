The TPM2 module from AliExpress contained an outdated firmware version 5.40.1971.2 and it was hard to find a suitable update for it.  
Hopefully this post will help somebody running into the same issue.

At [Epson](http://faq.epsondirect.co.jp/faq/dl/app/servlet/qadoc?036908) I found a compatible update.

However, my goal of enabling Secure Boot on my X10SLQ was not reached. It seems like TPM allows Trusted Boot, but not Secure Boot.
