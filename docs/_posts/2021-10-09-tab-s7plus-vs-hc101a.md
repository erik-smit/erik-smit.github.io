# Samsung Tab S7+ versus Blueendless HC101A

I got a Blueendless HC101A USB-C hub to experiment with my Samsung Tab S7+.

Here's some notes.

## Some notes
* 3.5mm audio output only works when VGA or HDMI is connected. Choose "Display Output" in Samsung Output Devices.
* HDMI -> DP cable doesn't work for me to attach a monitor.

## Power things.
Powerbank: Bluebuilt CBL1130
Tester: Mustcol UD18
AC adapter: FSP060-D1AR4

* When not connected the HC101A pulls ~1.1w from my powerbank
* When powering HC101A from my powerbank, it doesn't significantly charge Tab S7+.
* When powering HC101A from my AC adapter, it charges Tab S7+ with 9V/1.8A
