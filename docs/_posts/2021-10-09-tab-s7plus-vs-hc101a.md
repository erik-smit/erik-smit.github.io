# Samsung Tab S7+ versus Blueendless HC101A

I got a Blueendless HC101A USB-C hub to experiment with my Samsung Tab S7+.

Here's some notes.

## Some notes
* 3.5mm audio output only works when VGA or HDMI is connected. Choose "Display Output" in Samsung Output Devices.
* HDMI -> DP cable doesn't work for me to attach a monitor.

## Video things
* VGA and HDMI can be used at the same time. They get mirrored.
* By default the Tab S7+ screen gets mirrored to the video output.
* Until you start Dex, when you get a separate 1080p60 output from the Tab S7+.

## Power things.
Powerbank: Bluebuilt CBL1130
Tester: Mustcol UD18
AC adapter: FSP060-D1AR4

* When not connected to Tab S7+, the HC101A pulls ~1.1w from my powerbank.
* When powering HC101A from my powerbank via USB-C - USB-C cable, it pulls ~2w.
* When powering HC101A from my powerbank via USB-A - USB-C cable, it pulls ~4w.
* When powering HC101A from my AC adapter, it charges Tab S7+ with 9V/1.8A
