# Sheng Milo MX02S Infos

Here's some notes about my Sheng Milo MX02S.

# Brake Pads replacement. (~1950km)
I needed to replace my Sheng Milo MX02S Brake Pads at ~1950km

Brakes: XOD XD-H500. Seems to be a clone of the Tektro HD-E500.  
Replacement Pads: [BBS-52](https://bbbcycling.com/nl_nl/bbs-52-discstop-hp). Pads compatible with HD-E500 should be fine.

# Pedal replacement (1800km)
One of the pedals started havint trouble rotating around 1800km, so I replaced them.
Seems like pedal mounting is very standard.

# Bike Stem Riser replacement.
As the standard steering was a bit low for me, I replaced it with an adjustable bike stem riser.
I got an Hiland Universal Bike Stem Riser. 90mm/31.8mm.
